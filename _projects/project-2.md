excerpt: "The role of chromosomal inversions in climate adaptation and speciation"

Chromosomal inversions are stuctural variants that alter the order of genes on a chromosome and they can play a major role in complex trait evolution, adaptation and speciation. Inversions can operate through multiple mechanisms, such as causing frame-shift mutations and changes in gene expression patterns, and reducing recombination across the inverted region when being heterozygous (i.e. one chromosome has the inversion and the other does not). Given the complex nature of inversions, proving that they facilitate adaptation and speciation is challenging.

In this project, I characterize a new polymorphic inversion in the cold-adapted *Drosophila* malt fly, and investigate whether the inversion has contributed to the evolutionary history of the species by accumulating barriers to gene flow and adaptive loci. This project is hosted by [Dr Maaria Kankare](https://www.jyu.fi/en/research-groups/stress-genomics#toc--research-group-) at the [University of Jyväskylä, Finland](https://www.jyu.fi/en/science/bioenv/research/evoluutiotutkimus). A preprint of the project is expected to be out in the end of 2024!
