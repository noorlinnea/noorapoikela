excerpt: "The role of endosymbionts and hybridization in adaptation to warm temperatures"

Climate change, especially rising temperatures and more frequent heat waves, is rapidly modifying ecosystems and threatening biodiversity across the globe. To escape the heat, many species are migrating towards poles and higher altitudes, but migration alone may not be sufficient to protect them from heat stress in the future. While evolutionary adaptation through genetic change can help avoid local extinctions, heat tolerance may have low capacity to evolve through random mutations or existing genetic variation. Alternative strategies, like protective endosymbiotic bacteria or hybridization with close relatives, may be essential in rapid heat adaptation.

In this project, I investigate whether the presence of endosymbionts or a transfer of heat-adapted alleles from a heat-tolerant to a heat-sensitive species facilitate adaptation to warm temperatures. To answer these questions, I use phenotypic and experimental evolution approaches combined with genomics in two *Drosophila* malt fly species. I work in [Prof Mike Ritchie's](https://research-portal.st-andrews.ac.uk/en/persons/michael-gordon-ritchie) lab at the [Centre of Biological Diversity in the University of St Andrews, Scotland](https://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/biodiversity/). I'm super excited about this project and I can't wait to publish the results!

Since I do the research indoors, I like to spend my free time exploring historical towns and the breathtaking views of Scottish nature.
