Speciation is the evolutionary process by which populations of a single species diverge into two or more distinct species, contributing to the richness of biodiversity. Over time, genetic differences accumulate between populations, creating reproductive barriers that prevent them from interbreeding or producing fertile offspring. These reproductive barriers are key to the formation of new species. Demonstrating how speciation occurs and how distinct species are maintained at genetic and phenotypic level is essential for understanding the mechanisms that drive and sustain biodiversity.

In my PhD, I studied how different genetic (e.g. chromosomal inversions and introgression) and phenotypic (premating, postmating-prezygotic and postzygotic barriers, as well as cold phenotypes) mechanisms contribute to speciation and ecological divergence (adaptation) in two cold-adapted malt fly species. To answer these questions, I utilized phenotypic and experimental introgression approaches, genomic data of natural populations, demographic modelling and the RNA interference (RNAi) gene silencing method.
