I'm an evolutionary geneticist and I'm interested in understanding how climate change and other human-induced disturbances affect natural populations, how populations can respond to these changes, and how these changes modify the levels of biodiversity.

I'm currently working as a postdoc at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, exploring the role of host-endosymbiont interactions and hybridization in adaptation to high temperatures. More about my background and research projects can be found on [Main projects](/noorapoikela/projects/) and [CV](/noorapoikela/cv/).

In my free time, I love exercising, exploring nature, playing problem solving games, and listening to live music with friends.
